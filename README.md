## Cloning And Setting Up The Project
This project was started by forking a repository to my local repository
The files used in this project are html,css and javascript.
While working on the project, regular adds and commits were made and the final result pushed to github.

## What I Have Learnt
This project has enhanced my combination of the three basic languages of web development to produce a decent result.
Also time management, research skills were some equally good attributes I have picked up while working on this
project.
This project has exposed me into what actually goes on when a developer works on something and I am grateful for the experience. Needless to say many such experiences will come my way.
