<h3>Cloning And Setting Up The Project</h3>
<p>This project was started by forking a repository(DCIT_205_IA) to my local repository.</p>
<p>The remote repo was further cloned to my machine in VSCODE using my SSH key.</p>
<p>While working on the project, regular adds and commits were made and the final result pushed to github</p>

<h3>What I Have Learnt</h3>
<p>This project has enhanced my combination of the three basic languages of web development to produce a decent result.
Also time management, research skills were some equally good attributes I have picked up while working on this
project.
This project has exposed me into what actually goes on when a developer works on something and I am grateful for the experience.
Needless to say many such experiences will come my way.</p>.
